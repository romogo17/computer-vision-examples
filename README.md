# computer-vision-examples

This repo contains examples of different Computer Vision tasks. It gathers examples using OpenCV as well as other libraries.

Some examples are gathered from [LearnOpenCV](https://www.learnopencv.com/), and others are made by me.

There are installation scripts for some popular C++ libraries like OpenCV and Dlib under the `scripts/` directory
